Coding conventions:

-write Doc Comments:
    (I dont know what you wrote and in 3 days neither u are going to remember what you wrote )
-dont over engineer. Better to write a simple thing twice than write a super complex super nested code (Chat is writing it not u so u can do it twice)

-make functions statically typed we are all bad at codiong this way its easier to avoid errors but most importantly to debug, because for sure we will have to debug!

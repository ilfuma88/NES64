Coding conventions:

-write Doc Comments:
    (I dont know what you wrote and in 3 days neither u are going to remember what you wrote )
-dont fucking over engineer. Better top wrote a simple thing twice than write a super complex shit (Chat is writing not u so u can do it twice)

-make functions fucking statically typed we are all bad at codiong this way its easier to avoid errors
